# TCMB-Currency-Rates https://doviz.mevlutcanvar.com.tr/
A PHP page like a widget that can load currency rates from Central Bank Of The Republic Of Turkey and present a calculator for changing the currencies among themselves.

Uses bootstrap theme and bootstrap-table as framework and also uses JQuery.

Currency rates are taken from http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/kurlar/today.xml
